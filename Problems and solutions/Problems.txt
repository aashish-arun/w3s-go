    Concepts: Syntax, basic Go structure, fmt package.

2. Basic Variables and I/O
    Goal: Write a program that prompts the user for their name and age, then prints a greeting.
    Concepts: Variables, basic input/output, fmt.Scan.

3. Basic Functions
    Goal: Write a function to calculate the area of a rectangle given width and height, and call it in main.
    Concepts: Functions, return values, parameters.

4. Control Flow (Loops and Conditionals)
    Goal: Write a program that takes a number n as input and prints if each number from 1 to n is odd or even.
    Concepts: Loops, conditionals, basic math.

5. Arrays and Slices
    Goal: Write a function that takes a slice of integers and returns the sum of its elements.
    Concepts: Arrays, slices, looping over collections.

6. Maps (Dictionaries)
    Goal: Write a program that counts the occurrence of each word in a given string.
    Concepts: Maps, strings, looping over maps.

7. Structs and Methods
    Goal: Create a Person struct with fields for name and age, and a method that returns a greeting message.
    Concepts: Structs, methods.

8. Interfaces
    Goal: Define an interface Shape with a method Area() and implement it for both a Rectangle and a Circle struct.
    Concepts: Interfaces, polymorphism.

9. Concurrency with Goroutines
    Goal: Write a program that launches two goroutines: one that prints "Ping" and another that prints "Pong" in an alternating fashion.
    Concepts: Goroutines, channels, concurrency.

10. Error Handling and Custom Errors
    Goal: Write a function that divides two numbers and returns an error if the divisor is zero.
    Concepts: Error handling, custom error messages.

11. JSON Serialization and Deserialization
    Goal: Write a program that defines a User struct, then serializes an instance of User to JSON and deserializes it back to a struct.
    Concepts: JSON encoding/decoding, encoding/json package.

12. Advanced Error Handling with Custom Types
    Goal: Create a custom error type that includes additional context (e.g., a code or description) and implement the Error() method.
    Concepts: Custom error types, error handling.

13. Using Context for Timeout and Cancellation
    Goal: Write a function that simulates a time-consuming task, allowing it to be canceled early using context.Context.
    Concepts: Context management, cancellation, timeouts.

14. Concurrency with sync.WaitGroup
    Goal: Launch multiple goroutines that each print a message after a delay, using sync.WaitGroup to ensure the main function waits for all goroutines to finish.
    Concepts: Synchronization, sync.WaitGroup.

15. Reading and Writing Files
    Goal: Create a program that writes a list of strings to a file and then reads the file content back.
    Concepts: File I/O, os and io/ioutil packages.

16. Creating and Using Goroutines with sync.Mutex for Safe Access
    Goal: Write a program where multiple goroutines increment a shared counter, using sync.Mutex to ensure data safety.
    Concepts: Mutex, race conditions, data safety.

17. Implementing a Simple Web Server
    Goal: Create a simple web server in Go that responds with "Hello, Web!" when accessed.
    Concepts: net/http package, creating HTTP handlers, routing.

18. Writing Tests with the testing Package
    Goal: Write a simple test for a function that adds two numbers, using Goâ€™s testing package.
    Concepts: Unit testing, testing package.

19. Concurrency with Select and Buffered Channels
    Goal: Implement a program where two goroutines send messages through a buffered channel and the main goroutine reads messages selectively with select.
    Concepts: Buffered channels, select statements.

20. Building a REST API
    Goal: Create a REST API with routes to create, retrieve, update, and delete users, using JSON as the data format.
Concepts: RESTful APIs, HTTP methods, JSON, routing.

Note:
    Questions 01 - 10 covers basic to intermediate Go programming concepts, suitable for PBL by building on each previous concept.
    
    Questions 11 - 20 introduce more advanced Go concepts, including concurrency, web development, and testing, which are crucial for developing scalable applications in Go.
